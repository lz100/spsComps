          #     ### about the component
          #     Depending on the SPS option of "mode" you choose, it will render different UI.
          #     This is especially convenient if you have different deploy environment, like
          #     local computer and <https://shinyapps.io>. To change file upload
          #     strategy, you **do NOT need to rewrite the code**, you only need to
          #     change the global SPS "mode" setting from `local` to `server`.
          #
          #     ### modes
          #     1. `local` mode will not copy file, directly use a path pointer, good
          #     for large files. So you can directly choose file from the server-end file system.
          #     It is recommended to use if run the app on your own computer (user-end,
          #     server-end are both your current computer). Use this mode on deploy environment
          #     like <https://shinyapps.io> will allow users to reach part of file system on the
          #     server (not recommended).
          #     2. `server` mode upload file over web interface and store in temp. User
          #     do not have access to your server file system, but if you run the app
          #     on your own computer, server and user are on the same computer. This
          #     will cause a redundant copy of the target file. Secure, but slow and
          #     not friendly for large files.
          #
          #     ### other tips
          #     - `dynamicFile` is used on UI.
          #     - `dynamicFileServer` is used on server to get the uploaded file path.
          #
          #     A demo file called "dynamicFile_demoxxxxx.txt" has created for you to choose
          #     under `local` components.

          #   For a Shiny app, we often want to display some example data and then allow

          #   - This function is often combine with the `dynamicFile` component

          #   - It is "crash-free". Unlike normal `read.xxx` R functions which
          #   return errors if the file cannot be parse and often this will crash
          #   the Shiny app, this function will report the error to user and log it
          #   on server, then block the rest of the code in the same reactive context
          #   continues. Similar to the `shinyCatch` components (see Server Components tab),
          #   but a special variant to handle files.
